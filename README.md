radlands
========

Radlands is a simple project to help learn GitHub pages and Jekyll. It's a real website based on a local skatepark that do not have a current website.

My aim is to create a blog on the skatepark coverage and to help get all the social media coverage into a hub of its own. 

Server side scripting is not currently available so I hope these hurdles will help me develop my knowledge rather than going for the trusty Wordpress solution. I hope this project will be long term with GitHub pages however it maybe short lived if the hurdles are too high. In which case I will revert to the conventional method of Wordpress.
