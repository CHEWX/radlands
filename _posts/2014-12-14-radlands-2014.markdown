Skate Attic loves Northampton

So this is Ash Seck's 2014 Radlands edit. Ash thinks this is one of the worst edits he's ever made. Luckily the skateboarding in it is really good and will hopefully make up for it!

Thank you for watching, supporting Skate Attic and most of all, Thank you all for supporting skateboarding in Northampton.
