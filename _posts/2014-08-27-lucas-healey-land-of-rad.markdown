This is the first edition of a series of short video parts in association with Radlands plaza featuring some of the next up and coming skaters from around the UK. Trying to keep the Radlands legacy going this year hoping to have a few comps in the summer for all to join.

Arkology would like to thanks everyone involved in the new LAND OF RAD Project Damian Ince, Rob Selley Skate Attic, Wheelscape, Shaun Corlick, Alex thornhill, Jack Peney and the lifelong records team. and none the less Lucas Healey coming through with his part please like share and comment.
